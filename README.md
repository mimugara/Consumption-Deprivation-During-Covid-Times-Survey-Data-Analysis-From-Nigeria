# Consumption Deprivation During Covid Times: Survey Data Analysis From Nigeria 

COVID-19 disrupted production networks generating scarcity of many goods
while simultaneously individuals suffered financial stress due to the inability
to work. In this study we analyze factors affecting households consumption
and deprivation of basic goods. We use Nigerian survey data to document
how large is consumption deprivation, its main reasons and test whether
income related proxies, household location or ethnicity play any role. Our
research shows that rural residents exhibit higher deprivation, in most goods,
and that high-income households experience less, whereas financially constrained households only affect deprivation of the less needed good (i.e.,
corn). In addition, we find that being part of one of the many ethnic minorities only increases deprivation in one good (i.e., beans). Other variables
such as having kids at school do not have any impact.
